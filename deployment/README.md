# Deployment scripts

This folder contains scripts used for the deployment of this domain in Google Cloud infrastructure. Scripts read parameters values from `../params.yaml` in the root directory. 

The algorithm to parse yaml files is in `yaml.sh` which was obtained from [jasperes/bash-yaml](https://github.com/jasperes/bash-yaml/blob/c3a93b5230e3e5e57c9649c6f2b68889cd9b9604/script/yaml.sh).
